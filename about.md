# Texture Workshop

A **texture pack** index for [Texture Loader](mod:geode.texture-loader)!

## How it works
Downloads the texture pack's zip directly to Texture Loader's packs folder! No need to unzip!

## How do I submit a texture pack?
Easy!
Join the [Uproxide's Little Land](https://discord.gg/pUGPY9hQ22) Discord server,
go to the **#texture-packs forum channel** and **read FAQ**, then create a post with the following information:
- Name of Texture Pack
- Creator
- Version
- Download URL (GitHub or direct download)
- Icon
- Description
- Resolutions (Low, Med, High)
- Game Version

And that's about it! Wait until a **Texture Pack Mod** reviews your texture pack, and if they approve, it will be added!
